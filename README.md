Discord Rat (Remote Access Trojan)
Compile with Compiler.py
When the .py is compiled it is UD on uncoverit.org meaning they cant get your bot token, and its also UD on most av's including microsoft.
You also have options with the compiler like, should the exe have a window when ran, should the exe have a icon, and should the exe be added to startup when ran. (its added as microsoft)
I will be adding more commands soon!!
